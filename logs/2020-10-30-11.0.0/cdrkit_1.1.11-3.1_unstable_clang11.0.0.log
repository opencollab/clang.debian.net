    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "isovfy" links to some libraries for which the linker must
  search:

    pthread

  and other libraries with known full path:

    /<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/build/wodim/libwodimstuff.a

    /<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/build/librols/librols.a
    /<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/build/libunls/libunls.a

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "isovfy" links to some libraries for which the linker must
  search:

    pthread

  and other libraries with known full path:

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for

      cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "isovfy" links to some libraries for which the linker must
  search:

    pthread

  and other libraries with known full path:

    /<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/build/wodim/libwodimstuff.a

    /<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/build/librols/librols.a
    /<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/build/libunls/libunls.a

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for

 Description: Creates ISO-9660 CD-ROM filesystem images
  genisoimage is a pre-mastering program for creating ISO-9660 CD-ROM
  filesystem images, which can then be written to CD or DVD media using
  the wodim program. genisoimage includes support for making bootable
  "El Torito" CDs, as well as CDs with support for the
  Macintosh HFS filesystem.
  .
  The package also includes extra tools useful for working with ISO images:
   * mkzftree - create ISO-9660 image with compressed contents
   * dirsplit - easily separate large directory contents into disks of
     predefined size
   * geteltorito - extract an El Torito boot image from a CD image
  .
  Please install cdrkit-doc if you want most of the documentation and
  README files.

 Description: Creates WAV files from audio CDs
  icedax lets you digitally copy ("rip") audio tracks from a CD, avoiding
  the distortion that is introduced when recording via a sound card. Data
  can be dumped into raw (cdr), wav or sun format sound files. Options control
  the recording format (stereo/mono; 8/16 bits; sampling rate, etc).
  .
  Please install cdrkit-doc if you want most of the documentation and
  README files.
